## What Are Mandatory Questions?

(See Figure 1)

A work order can contain different checklist items that are marked as required. This means that the work order assignee will see the required checklist items as mandatory questions on the mobile App checklist forms and will have to fill them out or specify a reason why he did not.

<img src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/purpleheadband.images/wiki/mobile-app/mobile-app-flow/New+features+v+1.0.18.23/Figure+1.png' width=1000><br>

**Figure 1: Mandatory Questions**

### Marking an Item as Required

(See Figure 2 to Figure 5)

Checklist list items of an existing work order or a new work order can be marked as required, and therefore will become mandatory questions to fill out on the mobile App checklist forms by the assignee.

In order to mark a checklist item as required, perform the following steps:

###### 1) Open the **Workforce Management** interface (1).
###### 2) Create a new work order (2) or open an existing one (3).

_Result:_ On the mobile App checklist forms, the checklist items will appear as mandatory questions (see the **Mandatory Questions on The Mobile App** section).

### Mandatory Questions on The Mobile App

(See Figure 6 to Figure 8)

**Figure 7: Mandatory Questions**

The assignee can still finish and upload the work order, but in order to do so he will have to specify a reason why he did not fill out the mandatory question, for example:

**Figure 8: Not Completing Checklist Reason**

**note** After uploading the work order the checklist forms questions, including the mandatory questions, cannot be edited or updated.

## What are Duplicated Questions?

(See Figure 9)

Duplicated questions are created by duplicating existing questions from a checklist form.

This feature is used by the assignee in order to duplicate questions to fill out on a form for a repetitive assignment, for example, if the assignee needs to check that he installed a cable but there are more cables than one.
