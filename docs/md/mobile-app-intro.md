> Manage and track your equipment and deployments using a mobile app

The Mobile App is a mobile extension of the web-based Inventory and Work Orders system.  It can be used to manage equipment, view locations, perform Work Order checklists and site surveys, and create connectivity coverage maps.

## Device Requirements
The mobile app is only available for Android devices.  We recommend devices that meet the following __minimum requirements__:
* Android version 5.0 Lollipop (SDK API level 21)
* Camera
* 802.11 Wi-Fi
* Cellular capabilities
* GPS capabilities
* 200MB available storage

Recommended capabilities would meet or exceed the following:
* Android version 9 (SDK API level 28)
* 802.11 Wi-Fi supporting both 2.4GHz (b/g/n) and 5GHz frequency bands (a/h/j/n)
* Cellular capabilities supporting CDMA, WCDMA, GSM, LTE, and fixed-wireless bands (e.g. 42/43/48)

### Recommended Devices
* Samsung Galaxy S8 or above
* Google Pixel 2 or above
* OnePlus 7 or above
* LG V50 ThinQ or above
* Motorola Moto Z2 Play or above

## Getting the App
The latest version of the Mobile App is available in the Google Play Store to pass-listed accounts:
[https://play.google.com/apps/testing/cloud.thesymphony](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/cloud.thesymphony)

If that link is unavailable to your Google Play Store account, please notify your contact at Facebook (or email symphony-support@fb.com) to ensure all software usage agreements are in place and then you can be added to the pass-list.  The app is not available to the general public at this time so you will need to accept an agreement on the Google Play Store to become a beta user.

## Login
Login to the app using the same username/password that you use for the web UI.  Use the subdomain of this site for the `Company` field.  For example, if this page is at https://testing.thesymphony.cloud use `testing` for the Company name.
