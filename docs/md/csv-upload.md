title: Importing Inventory Data    
---

## Step 1: Manual Definitions

(See Figure 1)

The following must be defined manually before uploading inventory data via CSV:

- Locations Types - using the PerformanceCatalog (1), verify that the location types are defined by their order, under the LOCATIONS tab (2), drag and drop the location types to arrange them in a hierarchical order - from largest to smallest.

Figure 1: Locations 
</p>

- Equipment Types
- Port Types

## Step 2: Create a CSV Template

Export the relevant data to CSV (which will be the template for the upload) according to the steps described in the Exporting Your Data section (add a link TBD).

**note** The CSV file should be of UTF-8 format.

There are five different upload flows for exported data:

- Exported Equipment (for add and edit)
- Exported Ports (edit only)
- Exported Links (add &amp; edit)
- Exported Locations (edit only)
- Exported Services (add &amp; edit)

## Step 3: Importing data

Once the CSV file is exported, it can be modified and used in order to upload new records or edit existing ones.

### Equipment

The following sections describe equipment data upload information and procedures.

#### Step 1: Editing Existing Equipment

(See Figure 2 to Figure 5)

Figure 2: Equipment ID Column
</p>

- Equipment ID (1):
- If the value of the Equipment ID column is not empty, a row will be treated as to be edited.
- As long as the value of the Equipment ID column is empty, a row will be treated as to be added.

- Possible fields to be edited:
- Equipment Name (2) - for renaming an equipment instance.

Figure 3: Equipment Name
</p>

**note** If an equipment is being renamed and it has references to it farther down the CSV (as parent equipment for example) - edit those as well to reflect the new name.

- External ID (3).

<img src='https://s3.amazonaws.com/purpleheadband.images/wiki/Inventory+management/Importing+data/Figure+4.png' width=1000> <br>
Figure 4: External ID Column
</p>

- Every property (4).

A Property is editable as long as the corresponding Equipment Type supports it.

Correspondence can be verified under PerformanceCatalog/EQUIPMENT/Equipment Types (5).

Figure 5: Properties
</p>

#### Step 2: Adding New Equipment

(See Figure 6)

Fill/edit the following fields in the CSV:

- Equipment Name
- Equipment Type - must be an existing name
- External ID - (optional) an ID from a third-party system
- List of locations, hierarchical order - from largest the smallest.

**note** A new location will be added automatically without location properties.

- Parent Equipment (3) - if exists
- Position (3) - if exists
- Parent Equipment (2) - if exists
- Position (2) - if exists
- Parent Equipment - if exists
- Equipment Position - if exists

**note** Equipment positions will not be added automatically, they must exist and be available in advance of the new import run.
